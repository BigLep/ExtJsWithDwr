Examples to demonstrate ExtJsWithDwr
====================================

Any example to demonstrate how to use Ext JS with DWR should be added here.  These examples can be viewed at http://biglep.s156.eatj.com/extJsWithDwrExamples/.

## Directory/file explanations ##
* src - Any Java code (e.g. classes exposed by DWR) should be located here.  These classes are using the default (empty) Java package.
* webapps - This directory is to mimic Tomcat's webapps directory.  Any webapps to demonstrate the example should be placed here.  
* examples.jardesc - This is an Eclipse helper file for generating a jar file for the examples source code and placing it within webapps/extJsWithDwrExamples/WEB-INF/lib/.
